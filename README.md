ALX SIMPLE SHELL COLLABORATIVE TEAM PROJECT

This is our official repository for our ALX SWE simple shell collaboration project
#Let's Do Hard Things

The project was completed using Betty linter, shell and C language

This project is a simple implementation of a UNIX command line shell written
in the C language. It provides basic functionality such as executing commands, handling
input/output redirection and managing pipelines.

The shell works in both interactive and non-interactive mode.

Usage:
To use the shell, compile the source code and run the resulting executable file in your terminal:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror  -pedantic *.c -o hsh $ ./hsh

Once the shell is running, the user is able to enter commands like you would in a normal terminal.

This shell was developed by the following contributors:

Tekoh Palma Achu and Isabelle Ohaga
